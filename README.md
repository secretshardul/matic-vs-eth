# Matic vs Ethereum
Ethereum gas prices are skyrocketing ($10 for safe slow today ðŸ˜µ). Matic is a layer 2 solution which overcomes the scalability limitations of Ethereum. I couldn't find a quantitative comparison between the two, so I built this dashboard.

## Features
- Compare Matic and Ethereum gas prices over time
- Column graph comparing gas prices in Gwei
- A head on gas cost analysis for slow, medium and fast transactions on both the networks.

A dashboard comparing token and gas prices of Matic and Ethereum.
